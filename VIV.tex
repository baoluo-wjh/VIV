\begin{abstract}
Vortex-induced vibration (VIV), among all the anomalous oscillations, 
is one of the most common jeopardies facing cable-stayed bridge cables 
and suspension bridge cables. Typically, this kind of vibration tends 
to cause large cable displacement and thus imposes baneful implications 
upon cables. Therefore, it is essential to design an efficient method 
to spontaneously recognize such vibrations and send instant warnings. 
Recently, the Hilbert Transform (HT) are utilized to analyze and extract 
the single-modal attribute of VIV. Albeit accurate, this method is 
somewhat time-consuming due to the O(nlogn) time complexity. To boost 
the efficiency, this paper proposes a derivative indicator based on 
discrete numerical differentiation with an O(n) time complexity, thus 
remarkably ameliorating the monitoring method and offering an obvious 
advantage to the on-time warning. Thereafter, a novel method applying 
multiple indicators together with various clustering algorithms is used 
to cope with the abnormal vibration time history of a long-span 
cable-stayed bridge, which proves both the accuracy and efficiency of 
such a method. Moreover, a statistical analysis also demonstrates the 
identity between the indicator extracting from HT and that deriving from 
numerical differentiation, with respect to single-modal vibration 
recognization.

\section{Introduction}

Known for its frequent occurrence in cable-stayed bridges and suspension 
bridges, vortex-induced vibration (VIV) usually brings about large cable 
displacement and follows irrevocable detrimental implications. Therefore, 
it is essential to conceive an efficacious method that can spontaneously 
recognize VIV and send instant warnings. Generated by vortices 
periodically separating from either side of a bluff body when fluid 
passes it, the force that causes VIV is represented by a non-dimensional 
number, i.e., the Strouhal number, which can be calculated by 

\begin{equation}
    St = \frac{fD}{U},
    \label{eq:Strouhal}
\end{equation}

where $St$ is the Strouhal number and $f$, $D$ and $U$ refer to the 
frequency of the airflow, the diameter of a bridge 
cable, and the speed of the airflow, respectively \cite{jafari2020windinduced}. 

Traditionally, three major methods are frequently utilized to explore 
the principle of VIV, i.e., theoretical analyses, computational fluid 
dynamics simulations, and wind tunnel tests. Nevertheless, the mechanism 
underlying VIV is still uncovered due to the high nonlinearity of 
airflow and cable-fluid interaction. Nowadays, the prevalence of 
Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system offers a tremendous 
opportunity for the big-data-based study of cable vibration. Due to 
their convenience and relatively low price, accelerometers are widely 
used in SHM systems as the major data resources. The root mean square (RMS) 
of acceleration time history is then deemed as the prime indicator to 
quantify the cable vibration intensity. However, more information is 
deserved to distinguish the VIV from other anomalies, since multiple 
kinds of abnormal vibrations could cause large-acceleration vibrations. 
Typically, researchers employed the Fourier transform to obtain either 
the frequency spectrum or power spectrum, which can be used to analyze 
the excited modes. The spectrum with a single high peak indicates the 
occurrence of VIV since this kind of vibration usually comprises only 
one major vibration frequency \cite{li2018datadriven}. 

Recently, scholars presented numerous innovative methods to detect VIV 
from acceleration time history. Huang, Z. et al. \cite{huang2019automatic} 
employs Random Decrement Method to deepen the difference between VIV 
and normal ambient vibration, thus making it more precise for VIV 
identification. To automatically sieve out the non-stationary section of 
the so-called abnormal vibration, i.e., the VIV, Zhao, H. et al. 
\cite{zhao2022statemonitoring} takes advantage of Gaussian mixture 
modeling of the envelope of time history. After that, the stationary 
section is selected to extract modal parameters. Among all these methods, 
the novel algorithm based on the Hilbert Transform (HT) 
is one of the most prevalent. A composite complex analytic signal, whose 
real part is the original signal while the imaginary part represents the 
HT of the original, is introduced into this method. The projection of 
such a signal on the complex plain reflects the constituent of the 
vibration, as Dan, D. and Li, H. \cite{dan2022monitoring} suggest, the 
more it resembles a hollow ring, the more exact its single-mode attribute, 
and thus the more exact the occurrence of vortex-induced vibration. 
Although the method that employs HT is precise, it is somewhat 
time-consuming, since based on the Fast Fourier transform, whose time 
complexity is O(nlogn). To enhance the time efficiency, this paper 
proposes a derivative indicator based on discrete numerical 
differentiation, which has an O(n) time complexity, thus obviously 
lowering the calculative time and bringing about a dependable on-time warning. 

Furthermore, since any individual indicator might fail to distinguish VIV 
from normal vibration due to complicated environmental effects, more 
indicators should be taken into consideration. He, M. et al. \cite{he2022online} 
present two indicators based on the power spectrum and HT analytical 
signal respectively. These two indicators are then employed to 
differentiate VIV and normal vibration based on a pre-set line that 
relies on practical experience. In addition to that, multifarious 
clustering algorithms are introduced to achieve unsupervised 
classification. He, M. et al. \cite{he2022identification} claim that 
KMeans might be the best choice to separate different kinds of vibrations 
since both hierarchical and density-based clustering entail some 
hyper-parameters that could not be precisely determined. Li, S. et al. 
\cite{li2017cluster}, however, use a novel clustering strategy deriving 
from the traditional density-based algorithm to detect the VIV in the 
beam of a suspension bridge. Nevertheless, KMeans applied by He, M. et al. 
\cite{he2022identification} is extremely sensitive to outliers, while the method 
employed by Li, S. et al. \cite{li2017cluster} demands laborious analysis 
when determining the number of cluster centroids. To overcome these 
shortages, a method applying the DBSCAN clustering algorithm is used 
in discriminating different vibrations based on RMS and the derivative 
indicator, i.e., the hollow coefficient of the derivative analytical 
signal (HCD). SHM data of a long-span cable-stayed bridge are analyzed 
accordingly, and the result proves both the accuracy and efficiency of 
such a method.

The remaining sections are organized as follows. The methodology of VIV 
identification is explicated in Sec.~\ref{sec:method}, where several 
indicators together with varied clustering algorithms are introduced. 
In Sec.~\ref{sec:experiment}, these methods are carried out to identify 
the VIV occurring in a long-span cable-stayed bridge cable, whose 
long-time acceleration time history is recorded by a SHM system. Finally, 
conclusions are drawn in Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Automated cable VIV identification method}
\label{sec:method}

\subsection{Key indicators for VIV recognization} 

To identify VIV from lengthy acceleration time history recorded by the SHM 
system, multiple indicators are demanded, among which the time domain 
feature and frequency domain feature are of vital importance. In the 
following content, three key indicators defined by the features of the 
two domains will be briefly explained. 

\subsubsection{Root mean square of acceleration time history}

When VIV occurs on a cable, its vibration is usually much more intense 
than in normal circumstances. Therefore, the RMS of a piece of 
acceleration time history $\{a_i\}$ is applied to represent the intensity 
of cable vibration, which can be calculated by 

\begin{equation}
    RMS = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_{i}^{2}},
    \label{eq:RMS}
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the length of the time series. Generally, the larger the RMS, 
the more likely a certain kind of abnormal vibration is to occur.

\subsubsection{Hollow coefficient of Hilbert analytical signal}

The RMS, though a helpful indicator to suggest the presence of abnormal 
vibration, purveys no additional information to discriminate VIV from other 
large-amplitude abnormal vibrations. Therefore, the single-modal property 
of large-amplitude VIV is taken into consideration by applying HT, 
which is demonstrated by 

\begin{equation}
    y(t) = x(t) * \frac{1}{\pi t} = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} 
            \frac{x(\tau)}{\pi(t-\tau)} dt, 
    \label{eq:hilb}
\end{equation}

where $y(t)$ and $x(t)$ represent the transformed signal and the 
original signal, respectively. 

The Hilbert analytical signal is then defined as a complex signal 

\begin{equation}
    z(t) = x(t) + iy(t),
    \label{eq:comp_sign}
\end{equation}

which consists of both the original 
signal $x(t)$ and the transformed signal $y(t)$. 

It is mathematically proved that the HT of a sine function is its 
corresponding cosine function and vice versa. According to this feature, 
if a cable is under an ideal VIV situation, i.e., the original acceleration 
signal is a sine function, the projection of its Hilbert analytical 
signal in the complex plane will be a circle (see Fig.~\ref{fig:proj_hilb}~(a), 
where all the physical quantities are normalized in advance). Practically, 
due to the wideband components of the force caused by the vortex and the 
influence of environmental noises, the projection of the analytical 
signal is a ring with an inner radius R1 and outer radius R2, as shown 
in Fig.~\ref{fig:proj_hilb}~(b).

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \subfigure[Ideal sine function]{
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{hilbert_ideal_sin.jpg} 
    }
    \qquad
    \subfigure[sine function with noises]{
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{hilbert_real_sin.jpg}
    }
    \caption{Projection of the Hilbert analytical signal of a sine 
            function in a complex plain.}
    \label{fig:proj_hilb}
\end{figure}

To quantify the single-modal feature of VIV, the HCH is defined by 

\begin{equation}
    HCH = \frac{R_1}{R_2},
    \label{eq:HCH}
\end{equation}

where $R1$ and $R2$ represent the inner radius and outer radius 
displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:proj_hilb}~(b).

It is understandable that the more the HCH is closer to one, the more 
similar the ring is to a circle, and thus the more obvious the emergence 
of single modal vibration is. 

\subsubsection{Hollow coefficient of Derivative analytical signal}

The analytical signal applying the signal transformed by HT as the 
imaginary part is indeed useful. Despite that, the long time it spent 
due to the O(nlogn) time complexity of HT makes it difficult for in-time 
detection and warning. To cope with this predicament, the Derivative 
Transform (DT) is defined as 

\begin{equation}
    \left \{
        \begin{aligned} 
            &\hat{y}(t) = \frac{dx(t)}{dt}, \\ 
            &y(t) = \frac{\hat{y}(t)}{max \left( \hat{y}(t) \right)},
        \end{aligned} 
    \right. 
    \label{eq:deri}
\end{equation}

which is designed to substitute the HT, while the composite complex 
signal can still be represented by Eq.~\eqref{eq:comp_sign}.

Overall, such a substitution reduces the time complexity to O(n), which 
descends from the calculative expense of the numerical differentiation 
of a time series. The feasibility of this replacement relies on the 
fact that the derivative of a sine function is a cosine function and 
vice versa. Moreover, one additional matter worth attention is that 
the new signal derived from the derivative transform should be normalized 
one more time since this process introduces a multiplier $\omega$, which 
is the circular frequency of a sine or cosine function. 

Similarly, the projection of the derivative analytical signal of the sine 
function in a complex plain is shown in Fig 2., where Fig.~\ref{fig:proj_deri}~(a) 
and Fig.~\ref{fig:proj_deri}~(b) represent the ideal condition and 
noise-influenced condition, respectively. HCD is correspondingly defined as 

\begin{equation}
    HCD = \frac{R_1}{R_2},
    \label{eq:HCD}
\end{equation}

whose variables have identical meanings to those in Eq.~\eqref{eq:HCH}.

    }
    \caption{Projection of the Derivative analytical signal of the sine 
            function in a complex plain.}
    \label{fig:proj_deri}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Brief introduction of clustering algorithm for sample classification} 

\subsubsection{KMeans algorithm}

The KMeans algorithm might be the simplest and most famous clustering 
algorithm among all of them. First of all, a hyper-parameter k, which 
means the number of clustering centroids, should be determined in advance. 
After that, the algorithm will automatically portion all data points 
into k classes, such that the sum of each point's distance to its 
nearest centroid gradually approaches the minimum value. This process 
might iterate for numerous times and the centroids will be dynamically 
relocated until no data point changes its classification.

\subsubsection{DBSCAN algorithm}

DBSCAN is an abbreviation of density-based spatial clustering of 
applications with noise. It can be inferred from its full name that this 
method is based on the density of data points that distribute in the 
sample space. To utilize this algorithm, two major hyper-parameters are 
entailed, i.e., the density threshold and the neighbor radius. One of the 
most important advantages of DBSCAN is that it can rule out a substantial 
number of noise and is thus robust to outliers, which is essential when 
dealing with practical engineering projects that are vulnerable to 
environmental noises, such as cable VIV detection. 

\section{Application to a long-span cable-stayed bridge}
\label{sec:experiment}

\subsection{The Tongling Yangtze River Bridge}

The methods and algorithms proposed in Sec.~\ref{sec:method} are 
applied for cable VIV identification of the Tongling Yangtze River 
(TYR) Bridge. Locating in Tongling City, Anhui province, the TYR bridge 
is a long-span cable-stayed bridge, whose cables intermittently suffer 
from VIV. Therefore, this research might help the bridge owner to 
detect VIV and send instant warnings.

\subsection{Description of Data Processing}

One cable in the TYR Bridge, which is attached to an accelerometer 
named ACC-C01-01, is applied to explicate the whole process. The original 
data provided by SHM system is the time history of acceleration within an 
hour, whose file type is MATLAB's mat file. First of all, the one-hour 
continuous time history is divided into several pieces by a time window 
with a length of 10 minutes and a slide step of 5 minutes, and the RMS 
of each time interval is calculated. Then, the Fast Fourier Transform 
follows to secure the frequency spectrum of acceleration. Furthermore, 
both the HT and the derivative transform are performed respectively to 
get the HCH and HCD. Finally, all the indicators, i.e., the RMS, HCH, 
and HCD are considered together by KMeans and DBSCAN to classify VIV and 
normal vibration. 

\subsection{Illustration of typical VIV and ambient vibration} 

As mentioned above, each one-hour continuous time history is sliced by 
a ten-minute time window. It is noteworthy that since the slide step of 
this time window is five minutes, there is a five-minute overlapping 
region between each two contiguous time windows. As a result, each 
one-hour raw data offers eleven samples.

The discrepancy between VIV and normal vibration is remarkable. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:time_freq_hilb_deri} shows the ten-minute time history, 
frequency spectrum, and projections of both the Hilbert analytical signal 
proposed by Dan, D. et al. \cite{dan2022monitoring} and the 
derivative analytical signal. It is noticeable that the RMS of VIV is 
much bigger than that in normal vibration. Moreover, the frequency 
spectrum of acceleration during VIV almost merely comprise one 
eigenfrequency, while that during normal condition contains multiple 
modal components. What's more noticeable, both the projections of the 
Hilbert analytical signal and derivative analytical signal display a 
hollow ring and solid circle in VIV and non-VIV circumstant, 
respectively. In a nutshell, the VIV manifests a strong attribution 
of large amplitude and approximately unimodal vibration.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \subfigure[Normal ambient vibration]{
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{normal.jpg} 
    }
    \qquad
    \subfigure[VIV]{
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{viv.jpg}
    }
    \caption{Time history, frequency spectrum, projections of the two 
            analytical signals in an hour.}
    \label{fig:time_freq_hilb_deri}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Statistic proof of the equivalence between HT and DT} 

Fig.~\ref{fig:time_freq_hilb_deri} indicates not only that the 
projections of the two analytical signals during VIV are distinct from 
that during non-VIV conditions, but that the two are almost identical 
when dealing with the same period of a signal. On the one hand, 
projections during the non-VIV are similar solid circles. On the other 
hand, those during the VIV are similar hollow rings with approximately 
equal inner radii and outer radii.

To further confirm the identity of the derivative transform and HT when 
recognizing VIV, Fig.~\ref{fig:HCH_HCD} plots all the samples into an 
HCD-HCH coordinate system, where all the scatter points almost distribute 
in the line $HCD = HCH$, which means these two indicators offer 
the same information to detect the single modality. 
Therefore, it is reasonable to replace 
the complicated HT with the much more efficient derivative transform. 
Another matter that demands attention is that all the normal vibration 
samples have an almost zero-value HCD and an almost zero-value HCH, 
making themselves concentrated in the coordinate origin and covered by 
some VIV sample points.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.64\textwidth]{HCH-HCD.jpg}
    \caption{Scatter diagram to compare HCH and HCD.}
    \label{fig:HCH_HCD}
\end{figure}

\subsection{VIV identification using various clustering algorithms} 

\subsubsection{Classification result of KMeans}

As mentioned above, RMS is used to represent the intensity of vibration, 
while both HCD and HCH quantify the single-modal degree. Herein, HCD is 
selected due to the low time complexity of the underlying derivative 
transform. The manual-labeled result is shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:HCH_HCD}~(a).

The KMeans algorithm is then applied to identify the VIV and non-VIV by 
classifying the sample points in the HCD-RMS coordinate system into two 
classes. Displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:label_kmeans}~(b), 
the diagram indicates a considerable 
difference between the manual labels and the KMeans classification results 
that many VIV sample points with an HCD of approximately zero and an RMS 
ranging from 50 to 65 are misclassified.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \subfigure[Label]{
        \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{RMS-HCD.jpg}

    }
    \caption{The classification of VIV and normal vibration using RMS and HCD.}
    \label{fig:label_kmeans}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Classification result of DBSCAN}

Similarly, DBSCAN is also introduced for VIV recognization, while the 
result is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:label_dbscan}~(b). Herein, 
the neighbor radius is set to 0.075, while the 
density threshold is set to one-tenth of the total number of samples. It 
is noteworthy that the DBSCAN classification manifests much more 
consistency with the manual label by contrast with the KMeans. Therefore, 
DBSCAN might be the better method for VIV identification.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

To detect the occurrence of VIV in bridge cable, two key indicators, i.e., 
the RMS and HCH, is utilized to extract certain feature from acceleration 
time history. Drawn in the HCD-RMS coordinate system, the vibration sample 
points can be divided into two classes by two clustering algorithms 
automatically. The proposed methods make it possible to achieve real-time 
warning of VIV in the future and the following conclusions can be drawn.

\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item 
RMS and HCH demonstrate high accuracy to quantify the vibration intensity 
and mono-modality of a certain signal. 
    \item
While offering nearly the same information compared with the HCH, the 
HCD is much more efficient, since based on the derivative transform, 
whose time complexity is O(n).
    \item
DBSCAN-based VIV-recognization is much more precise compared with that 
depending on the KMeans.
